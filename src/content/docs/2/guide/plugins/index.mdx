{/* TODO: Link to windowing system, commands for sending messages, and event system */}

Tauri offers a windowing system with web view functionality, a way to send messages between the Rust process and the web view, and an event system along with several tooling to enhance the development experience. By design, the Tauri core does not contain features not needed by everyone. Instead it offers a mechanism to add external functionalities into a Tauri application called plugins. Plugins are able to hook into the Tauri lifecycle, expose Rust code that relies on the web view APIs, handle commands with Rust, Kotlin or Swift code, and much more.

## Available Plugins

The official Tauri plugins can be found on the [features and recipes page](/2/guide/list/). Recipes explaining how to combine plugins for common use cases as well as community plugins can also be found on that page.

## Add to a Project

To add a plugin to a Tauri app, you can use the [`plugin add`](/2/reference/cli/#plugin-add) command.
For example, to install the [notification plugin](/2/guide/notification) run:

{/* TODO: `plugin add` is going to be renamed to `add` */}

<CommandTabs
	npm="npm run tauri plugin add notification"
	yarn="yarn tauri plugin add notification"
	pnpm="pnpm tauri plugin add notification"
	cargo="cargo tauri plugin add notification"
/>

Be sure to read the plugin's documentation to understand if any additional setup is required.

## Developing a Plugin

Need a Tauri functionality that is not covered by the available plugins? Check out how to [develop a Tauri plugin](./develop-plugin).

### Naming Convention

{/* TODO: Add link to allowlist */}

Tauri plugins have a `tauri-plugin-` prefix for the Rust crate name and a `@tauri-apps/plugin-` prefix for the NPM package. What comes after the prefix is the plugin name (specified on the plugin configuration under [`tauri.conf.json > plugin`](/2/reference/config/#pluginconfig) and on the allowlist configuration).
