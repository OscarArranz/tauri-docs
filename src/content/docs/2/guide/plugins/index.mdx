Tauri offers at its core a windowing system with webview functionality, a way to send messages between the Rust process and the webview,
and an event system along with several tooling to enhance the development experience. By design, Tauri does not fill its core crate with features not needed by everyone,
offering a mechanism to add external functionalities into a Tauri application instead. Plugins are able to hook into the Tauri lifecycle, expose Rust code that relies on the webview APIs,
handle new commands with Rust, Kotlin or Swift code and much more.

## Naming Convention

Tauri plugins have a `tauri-plugin-` prefix for the crate name and a `@tauri-apps/plugin-` prefix for the NPM package containing the API bindings for the plugin commands.
What comes after the prefix is the plugin name, which you need to reference when adding a new plugin, on the plugin configuration under `tauri.conf.json` and on the allowlist configuration.

{/* TODO: link to allowlist documentation when it is available */}

## Adding a Plugin to Your Project

To add a plugin to your Tauri application, you can use the [`plugin add`](/2/reference/cli/#plugin-add) command.
For example, to install the `notification` plugin, simply run:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">

    ```sh
    npm run tauri plugin add notification
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Yarn">

    ```sh
    yarn tauri plugin add notification
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">

    ```sh
    pnpm tauri plugin add notification
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Cargo">

    ```sh
    cargo tauri plugin add notification
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
